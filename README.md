Yes, I use code from the tutorial (https://youtu.be/v_raWlX7tZY) and improved it to make the animations.

Yes, you can use it to make your own animation, but in this case you should to edit the main.py in some places. After you need to create the folder "Frames" and to fill it with the images which will be frames. I used "Free Video to JPG converter". 

Yes, there is not mp3 file with music, because I am afraif of copyright, but you can easily take somewhere this audio, drop it into the projct folder and rename the file to "bad_apple.mp3".

Sorry for my english.
